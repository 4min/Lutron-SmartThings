# Homemations SmartThings Integrations

Homemations has created several SmartThings integrations:

- **RadioRA Classic SmartThings Bridge** - Provides the ability to integrate Lutron RadioRA Classic home lighting systems with SmartThings. The Bridge must by run on a system (such as a Raspberry Pi) with a physical RS232 serial connection to a Lutron RadioRA Classic hardware serial module (such as the RA-RS232 or Chronos).
