# Homemations SmartThings SmartApps and Device Handlers

Homemations has created several solutions for the SmartThings platform that provides for new integrations.  They are:

- **ISpyConnect Manager** - Provides the ability to integrate most 3rd party cameras into the SmartThings platform by providing the integration of the iSpyConnect platform APIs with SmartThings.  Using a local iSpyPro server, the world's #1 video surveillance software and a low cost subsciption.

- **Lutron RadioRA Classic SmartThings Bridge** - Provides the ability to integrate  Lutron RadioRA Classic home lighting systems with SmartThings. The Lutron RadioRA Classic SmartThings Bridge was also developed by Homemations using Python to expose RESTful APIs. The Bridge must by run on a system (such as a Raspberry Pi) with a physical RS232 serial connection to a Lutron RadioRA Classic hardware serial module (such as the RA-RS232 or Chronos).
