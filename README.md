# Homemations SmartThings Integrations

Homemations has created several SmartThings integrations:

- **ISpyConnect Manager** - Provides support for most third-party cameras with SmartThings by providing integration using the iSpyConnect APIs to a local iSpyPro server, the world's #1 video surveillance software and a low cost subsciption.

- **RadioRA Classic Smart Bridge** - RESTful server for integrating with Lutron RadioRA Classic light switches and dimmers (usable by any REST client), PLUS additional scripts for optional SmartThings integration. The Bridge must by run on a system (such as a Raspberry Pi) with a physical RS232 serial connection to a Lutron RadioRA Classic hardware serial module (such as the RA-RS232 or Chronos).
